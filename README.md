# Cub3D

🕹️ Develop a minimal 3D engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.

## Objectives
- Create a graphical window and display a 3D view using **raycasting**
- Implement player movements (forward, backward, left, right)
- Handle camera rotations
- Display a 2D minimap
- Read and parse a map file in `.cub` format
- Implement wall collision detection
- Support multiple textures for walls, floor, and ceiling

## Key Concepts
- **Raycasting** (2D projection → pseudo-3D rendering)
- Using the **MiniLibX** library
- Handling keyboard events and player movement
- Parsing `.cub` configuration files
- Managing textures (XPM format)
- Project organization (parsing, rendering engine, utils)
